<h1>Brief introduction</h1>
Bokke is a desktop project that mimics a shopping application. It can be run on any computer with an oracle server installed. Since the database is local, there was no need to share it, but it has all the functionality to do so. This is my biggest project and I have devoted all my free time to it.

<h1>Features</h1>
All screenshots were taken from an existing account that I used for testing.Some features, such as hover effects and alerts, can't be shown in screenshots (I'll make a gif or video in the future).

<h1>Technology used</h1>
<p>
The project is completely my idea, the look and code are built from scratch by me. The idea of the project was to build an application using a real relational database. All code was written in Java using javaFX framework.To write code i used IntelliJ IDEA. The graphical user interface was done using SceneBuilder, but many parts were done without it, just from code. For styling I used java fx CSS, which is very simple to normal CSS, but all properties have -fx at the beginning, for example :-fx-background-color: red; All database stuff was done in Oracle using a free local server and Oracle SQL developer for database management. The data in the application is updated in real time, so any new data entered or changed in the database is visible in the application immediately or after re-entering each section, for example: if a user changes their password or personal information, it will be changed immediately and the user will see it and be able to use it to log in without having to restart the application; if new books are added, the user will see it after going to another section and then returning to that section.All icons I used are free from : www.flaticon.com
and most of them are made by :<a href="https://www.flaticon.com/authors/juicy-fish" title="icons"> juicy_fish - Flaticon</a>
some of them I changed using GIMP, added background, some text or just changed resolution.<p>
